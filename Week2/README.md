# Focus
Learn how to make decisions in code and how to repeat actions using loops.

# Key Concepts
- `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- Comparison and logical operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `and`, `or`, `not`)
- `for` and `while` loops
- `break`, `continue`, `pass` keywords
- Iterating over sequences (e.g., strings, lists)

## Definitions
- `break`: Used to exit loop immediately
- `continue`: Used to skip current iteration of loop
- `pass`: Used for body of functions that don't do anything

# Exercise 1
Program that checks if a number is prime.

# Exercise 2
Counts from 0 to user-specified value, skipping by multiples of user-specifed value
